# Upload Folders

This directory contains uploaded images organized by folder:

- `/logos` - Brand logos and icons
- `/icons` - UI icons
- `/backgrounds` - Background images
- `/screenshots` - Screenshots
- `/general` - Miscellaneous uploads

**Note:** On Vercel, files uploaded via the app won't persist between deployments. 
For permanent storage, commit files directly to this folder or use external storage (Cloudinary, S3, etc.).
